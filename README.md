# Weather-dashboard
A simple dashboard. So, they said. This assignment uses a variety of technologies to generate one sole goal. Display the weather. As a developer, that information is absent in the creation of a website, so we must (as developers) look towards places that do have that information stored inside a server. These are called server-side APIs. They contain vast amounts of information that one can manipulate and push that information onto a page. The tools necessary are found within a few technologies recently presented to us, Jquery and Ajax. Using the OpenWeather API we are presented a plethora of information that we must use and manipulate to create a functional weather application in its diverse form.

* Here is the front page of this website that uses bootstrap (A CSS Framework) to create an elegant and organized look to the page.

## Installing 
Jquery, bootsrap, and Ajax are a series of third-party libraries that requires the proper CDN links to be able to use the full functionality of these libraries. A code snippet below shows the script tags located at the bottom of the HTML Doc. 

### Code Snippet

```
 <script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.5.1.slim.min.js" integrity="sha384-DfXdz2htPH0lsSSs5nCTpuj/zy4C+OGpamoFVy38MVBnE+IbbVYUew+OrCXaRkfj" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>

```
* These links are vital to the functionality in the use of these libraries. It's a simple link, but when missing attributes, can destroy the functionality of the page all together.
